Code sketch for baucis subscriptions using EventSource / Server Sent Events

This is a v0 early release example code sketch of a possible implementation for adding SSE support to baucis.  It doesn't compile and should not be relied on in production.

SSE is similar to WebSockets but enables richer semantics for real time communication between server and client.
